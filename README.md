To build a machine learning model that identifies the type of flowers in a dataset of images

It’s difficult to fathom just how vast and diverse our natural world is.
There are over 5,000 species of mammals, 10,000 species of birds, 30,000 species of fish – and astonishingly, over 400,000 different types of flowers.
In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that identifies the type of flowers in a dataset of images (for simplicity, we’re sticking to just over 100 types).

In this notebook, we have learnt how to use TPUs to speed up the training of machine learning models. Next, we looked at how to load and parse images 
from TFRecord files. Finally, we used the pre-trained ResNet152 V2 model to classify our images, while also tweaking the learning rate and trainable layers.
